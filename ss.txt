CICD Database Automation Deployment Framework:

I successfully developed and implemented a comprehensive Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) database automation deployment framework for both Oracle and PostgreSQL databases. The framework covered end-to-end testing, including Standalone and Active-Active replication environments, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of our database deployments.
As part of this initiative, I prepared automation scripts for Goldengate, a critical component for real-time data replication between databases.
To enhance the scalability and maintainability of our automation, I integrated Jenkins pipeline with service accounts, enabling seamless job execution across multiple environments.
Security being a top priority, I ensured the protection of sensitive data by encrypting passwords through Vault.
My efforts didn't stop at implementation; I also thoroughly documented the entire process, enabling the team to understand and maintain the framework effectively.
I presented the completed framework to the team for review, addressing their feedback and incorporating valuable suggestions.
CouchDB Onboarding Proof of Concept (POC):

I actively participated in the onboarding Proof of Concept (POC) for CouchDB, a NoSQL database management system.
Throughout the POC, I contributed to end-to-end testing, assessing the feasibility and functionality of CouchDB for our specific use cases.
My involvement in this POC helped the team in making informed decisions about adopting CouchDB as a potential solution.
MongoDB 6.x Certification:

I took a proactive role in the certification process for the latest version of MongoDB, version 6.x.
By actively participating in the certification process, I acquired in-depth knowledge and expertise in the new features and functionalities introduced in MongoDB 6.x.
My certification not only demonstrated my commitment to professional development but also contributed to enhancing the team's collective knowledge about the latest version of MongoDB.
Overall, I am pleased with the accomplishments made in the past year. Through the successful implementation of the CICD database automation framework, participation in the CouchDB POC, and obtaining MongoDB 6.x certification, I have contributed to the team's growth and the enhancement of our database management practices. In the future, I am eager to continue exploring new technologies and methodologies to further improve our database operations.
