I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide an update regarding the documentation review process and the pending meeting with the PostgreSQL DBE team.

As per the suggestion of Santosh Patil, I have shared the documentation wiki page for the DBE team or subject matter experts (SMEs) to review in advance. The purpose of sharing this documentation is to provide them with an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the content and be prepared for our upcoming meeting.

Currently, the review session for the documentation is still pending with the PostgreSQL DBE team. However, I want to assure you that I am actively following up on this matter. Rest assured, I will ensure your inclusion in the meeting so that you can actively participate and provide your valuable insights.

I will continue to monitor the progress and keep you updated on any developments. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I appreciate your patience and cooperation throughout this process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
